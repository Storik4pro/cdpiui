# What is CDPI UI?

CDPI UI is a new version of the popular graphical interface formerly known as GoodbyeDPI-UI. The new version has been updated with numerous bug fixes, improved stability, and improved performance.

The main goal of CDPI UI is to make access to utilities like Zapret and ByeDPI easier and more convenient for modern users.

## Simple, yet powerful

CDPI UI doesn't limit the capabilities of components in any way. If you're comfortable configuring components like Zapret or ByeDPI yourself, go for it!

The preset creation wizard makes creating new presets a breeze. Eye-pleasing flag highlighting and the ability to create variables for easy integration with the UI are designed specifically for advanced users.

## Standalone

The launch settings auto-selection mechanism has become even more stable. The new interface allows you to combine several working strategies for
multiple website lists into a single, unified one, without having to search for a new strategy online.
Offline help allows you to get support even without an internet connection.

## Customizable

The component store lets you choose only the components and presets you need. Nothing extra.

## Free forever

No subscriptions—all functionality is always available without restrictions. Technical support is also completely free.

Any paid support for the developer is optional, without pushy banners.

## Open-Source

You can change the app's code at any time or verify its security on the official GitHib repository.

## Fast

The app uses less than 10 KB of RAM when running in the background.
