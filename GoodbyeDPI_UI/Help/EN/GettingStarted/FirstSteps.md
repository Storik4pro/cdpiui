# First Steps

This guide will help you learn the basics of using CDPI UI and customize it.

- **Download the first component from the Store.** Go to the Store to download the component you need. At the time of writing, ready-made presets only exist for Zapret.
ByeDPI requires selecting a preset using GoodCheck (GoodCheck can be found in the "Add-ons" section of the Store).

- **Prepare the downloaded component for use.** Go to the settings page for the installed component and select the preset you want to use. (The component will automatically restart after changing the preset if it was previously running.) Also, keep in mind that some applications and services require restarting to obtain reliable information about their availability.

- **Configure component autostart.** Configuring autostart requires a few simple steps. First, enable the GUI autostart by using the toggle switch
[Open application when PC starts] on the [Settings] page in the main window. Next, go to the settings for the installed component and check [Start automatically] to ON.

Congratulations! The application setup has been successfully completed.

If some services become unavailable in the future:

- **Check for updates.** Go to the [Downloads] page in the Store and check for items that need updating. Update them if necessary.

- **Select a preset.** Go through the list of presets again – maybe one of them will work.

- **Use GoodCheck selection.** Find a working preset using GoodCheck – go to the [Utilities] page and start the selection by clicking [Automatic preset creation utility].
To select, you must have the "GoodCheck" add-on installed.
