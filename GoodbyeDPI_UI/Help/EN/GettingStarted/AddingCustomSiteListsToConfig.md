# Add custom site to list for bypass

To change the list of URLs/IP addresses to be crawled, go to the preset settings for the component you're using.

If the preset you're using uses site lists, you'll see the [Used Site Lists] widget. This widget lists all the sites to be crawled.
To edit them, simply click the [Edit] button next to the site/IP list name. The default .txt file editor will open for editing.

You can also view the specific arguments applied to a particular site list by clicking the [Show Applied Parameters] button next to the site/IP list.

### Please Note
Site/IP lists are not unique to each preset. Changing the list of websites/IP addresses will change it for all presets in the set.
(Except the "Local data storage" set, StoreId:`LocalUserStorage`)

### For advanced users
You can find out the working directories of preset sets in the Store. Go to the [Library] page, click the [Show more actions] button for the desired item, and select
[Show local files] from the drop-down list.
